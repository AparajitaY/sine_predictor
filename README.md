# sine_predictor
sine wave prediction using tensorflow to create regression model; numpy to generate sine values, create noise and to split train, validate and test data; matplotlib for visualizing; 
keras api used to create reqd models;
model 1: two layer nn- 16 neurons in first layer and one output so one neuron in 2nd layer;
failed to predict along wave, complexity not realised;
model 2: three layer nn- 3rd layer if 16 more neurons;
good generalization even with noise- loss of 0.0108 , mae of 0.820
